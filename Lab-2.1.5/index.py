# Use the print() function to print the line Hello, Python! to the screen. Use double quotes around the string.
print("Hello, Python!")

# Having done that, use the print() function again, but this time print your first name.
print("Darien")

# Remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?
# print(Darien) 
# Python shows and eError, saying name 'Darien is not defined. Points to where the error is

# Then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?
# print"Darien"
# Python tells me what I'm missing to call the print function

# Experiment as much as you can. Change double quotes to single quotes, use multiple print() functions on the same line, and then on different lines. See what happens.
